# MLOps - End to End Continuous Integration

This repository serves as a practical guide to understanding and implementing end-to-end Continuous Integration (CI) within the realm of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps). It demonstrates how to automate testing, validation, and deployment of ML pipelines using GitHub Actions.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to showcase the integration of CI practices in MLOps workflowsBy leveraging GitHub Actions, the repository automates the process of testing and validating machine learning models, ensuring that code changes do not break existing functionalities

## 🔄 Continuous Integration with GitHub Actios

The repository utilizes GitHub Actions to automate the CI procs. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and is triggered on every push or pull request to the `main` brach.

**Workflow Steps:**
1. **Checkout Code:** Retrieves the latest code from the repositry.2. **Set Up Python:** Configures the Python environmnt.3. **Install Dependencies:** Installs required Python packaes.4. **Run Tests:** Executes unit tests to validate code chanes.

This setup ensures that any code changes are automatically tested, promoting code reliability and facilitating collaboraton.
